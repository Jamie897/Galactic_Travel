We had many ideas and ended up attempting to a couple of sites but in the end neither one of them were able to work very well.
We wanted to progress on the bob ross project and then decided to make a rocket ship reservation space hub. You can reserve flights to space to see all of the planets. 
We used Node, React, Firebase, SQL, HTML and CSS.
We didn't have a time frame for each section but we wanted to get the bare bones done first before we started making it look nicer.
